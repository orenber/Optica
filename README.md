Optica - simulation of optic lens and Ray tracing

This software performs simulation of the optical system 
Through which you can: 
1. Add multiple lenses as you want and see where the refracted ray. 
1. See where created real and virtual images. 
1. Enter data in the lenses and see the all the data of the breaking light, 
1. Focus lens, front and back radius of the lens and more. 
 The software was written in object oriented programming and it also built a user interface:
